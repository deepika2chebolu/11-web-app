_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

Licensing
As we mentioned earlier, an open source license details how others can use your code. MIT and GPL are the most common licenses. An MIT license means your code is free to use by anyone and you are not liable for any problems in the software. Rails and jQuery are examples of software that use an MIT license. GPL also indicates free usage of the code but when used, the resulting work MUST be open source. Linux, Git and Wordpress all use GPL.

For additional details on choosing a license for your code, visit GitHub's Choose a License site.

Expectations
Moving forward, you're expected to include a detailed README.md file for every project you create here at Epicodus. This ensures that anyone who views your portfolios can quickly understand what you've created.

Towards the end of the program, all full-time students will spend a full day preparing materials for internship interviews and their future job search. In addition to writing cover letters, preparing a LinkedIn profile, and practicing interview questions, students are also required to ensure all their GitHub repos have detailed READMEs, as seen in this assignment. Make sure to create a README for each project now so you don't have to go back and add them later.

Also, the independent projects you turn in at the end of each section are required to include a README. If they don't, they won't be marked as passing.

For more information on creating a README, check out Make a README.
